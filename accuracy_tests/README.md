# accuracy-tests

This code, as written, currently requires a local copy of the FAC running, with public data loaded from 2016-2022.

A future version may operate on local/exported SQLite database files or some other source.

It can be modified to operate against the live FAC data (api.fac.gov), but it will run up against key request limits that are not present when running locally.
